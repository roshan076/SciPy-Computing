# Equation Solver - Code Explanation

This Python code implements a framework for solving mathematical equations, specifically **Linear** and **Quadratic** equations, using object-oriented principles. The main components are the abstract base class `Equation` and two subclasses `LinearEquation` and `QuadraticEquation`. Additionally, there is a solver function to process and present results.

## Classes

### 1. `Equation` (Abstract Base Class)
The `Equation` class is an abstract base class that defines the common structure and behavior for all equations. It requires subclasses to implement two methods: `solve` and `analyze`.

#### Attributes:
- `degree`: Specifies the degree of the equation (e.g., 1 for linear, 2 for quadratic).
- `type`: Specifies the type of the equation (e.g., "Linear Equation", "Quadratic Equation").
- `coefficients`: A dictionary of coefficients for the equation's terms, mapped from the highest degree to the constant term.

#### Methods:
- `__init__(self, *args)`: Constructor for initializing an equation. It validates the number of coefficients, their types, and ensures the highest degree coefficient is non-zero.
- `__str__(self)`: String representation of the equation in a human-readable format.
- `solve(self)`: Abstract method that needs to be implemented by subclasses to solve the equation.
- `analyze(self)`: Abstract method that needs to be implemented by subclasses to analyze the equation's properties.

### 2. `LinearEquation` (Subclass of `Equation`)
This class represents linear equations of the form `ax + b = 0`, where `a` is the coefficient of `x` and `b` is the constant term.

#### Methods:
- `solve(self)`: Solves the linear equation `ax + b = 0` and returns the solution as a list.
- `analyze(self)`: Returns the slope and y-intercept of the equation.

### 3. `QuadraticEquation` (Subclass of `Equation`)
This class represents quadratic equations of the form `ax^2 + bx + c = 0`, where `a`, `b`, and `c` are coefficients.

#### Attributes:
- `delta`: The discriminant of the quadratic equation, calculated as `b^2 - 4ac`. It determines the nature of the roots (real or complex).

#### Methods:
- `solve(self)`: Solves the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula. It returns a list of real solutions (if any).
- `analyze(self)`: Analyzes the quadratic equation and returns the vertex of the parabola (either the minimum or maximum point), along with the concavity (upwards or downwards).

## Solver Function
The `solver` function takes an `Equation` object as input, solves the equation, and generates a formatted string with the following information:
- Type and string representation of the equation.
- Solutions to the equation (if any).
- Details about the equation (e.g., slope and y-intercept for linear equations, vertex and concavity for quadratic equations).
